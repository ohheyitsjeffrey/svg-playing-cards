# SVG Playing Cards

![](./svg/ace_of_spades.svg)

A set of svg playing cards and a card back.  I did not create these, but combined them for a project and am redistributing them here in the event anyone else is looking for the exact same thing for a project.  Credits are as follows:

- Card Fronts : [https://github.com/notpeter/Vector-Playing-Cards](https://github.com/notpeter/Vector-Playing-Cards) (which is itself a fork of [https://code.google.com/p/vector-playing-cards/](https://code.google.com/p/vector-playing-cards/))

Enjoy!
